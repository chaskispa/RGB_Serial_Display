# RGB_Serial_Display
This project reads RGB color data over serial (from an Arduino or Beetle CJMCU device) and displays the color in fullscreen on a Raspberry Pi. The setup mirrors the output across two HDMI displays, making it suitable for installations or embedded displays that require synchronized visual feedback.
